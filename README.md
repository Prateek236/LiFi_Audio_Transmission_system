# LiFi_Audio_Transmission_system
This Project is simple non-microcontroller based project using simple components and IC. There are two parts of this system ; Transmitter and Reciever. 
Transmitter
It consists of 3 components:
(i) LED or LED Strip
(ii) Power supply
(iii) AUX cable
One terminal of LED is connected to power supply and another to AUX cable. 2nd Terminal of Power Supply is connected to 2nd terminal of AUX cable. After the connections, The AUX cable is connected to device and audio is played. The LED starts transmitting the audio. The data is transmitted by varying the intensity of light in accordance to the amplitude of audio being played.
Reciever
It consistes of 4 Components:
(i) Solar Panel
(ii) Amplifier circuit using LM356 IC
(iii) Potentiometer
(iv) Speaker
Solar panel receives signal in form of varing light intensity form LED in transmitter. The signal transduced by Solar Panel is too low to power the speaker. Therefore we use audio amplifier circuit using LM386 IC. The amplifier circuit given in reciever photo is NOT CORRECT. Please use correct input - output, power supply. Potentiometer is also part of this circuit. This potentiometer is used to control the volume of output audio. The output of amplifier circuit is connected to the Speaker.
